# KorgPi

Work in progress...

The goal is a musical sampler / synthesizer written in Kotlin (JVM) using [JACK](https://jackaudio.org/) 
as the mixer interface (with the help of [JNAJack](https://github.com/jaudiolibs/jnajack)) meant to run on a
Raspberry Pi.

This is just a fun project for me with the hope that I can learn more about audio development/programming 
while still enjoying it and using my preferred tools and workflow. The whole point is fun and knowledge and 
experience.

The aim is essentially a sampler akin to the 
[KORG PA 700 Oriental](https://www.korg.com/uk/products/synthesizers/pa700_oriental/) 's "SOUND" mode.
